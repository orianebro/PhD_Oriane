At the end of the growth of an internode, a leaf appears. The appearance of a leaf is triggered by fixed phyllochron (different for tillers?).  \n\nCf Fournier et al, 2005 for leaf elongation \n\nThe angle of the leaf with its axis is leaf-age dependent. The leaf blade curvature depends on the angle with the axis and the leaf length.  \n\nThe reproductive organs appear from a given thermal time, when the leaves have stopped growing. \n\nLeaf senescence is constrained by crop model, as it has a direct influence on LAI (green LAI vs. yellow LAI ?).  \n\nThe branching pattern is set (Tillers (Zhu et al., 2015)). \n\n## Time-dependent parametrization of leaf area\n\n$$ \\mathcal{A_normalized} = 2 * |\\int_{0}^{1} \\mathcal{C}(s(u))ds(u)| $$\n$$ \\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{A_scaled} = 2 * w * |\\int_{0}^{L} \\mathcal{C}(\\frac{s(u)}{L})d\\frac{s(u)}{L}| $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathcal{A}}{dt} = 2 * w * |\\int_{ds(t)/L} \\mathcal{C}(\\frac{s(u)}{L})d\\frac{s(u)}{L}| $$\n\n- $\\mathcal{A}$ : final leaf area (or surface), in $cm^2$ (given by crop model)\n- $\\frac{d\\mathcal{A}}{dt}$ : gain in area, in $cm^2$, for a given leaf for a given time step $dt$ (given by crop model)  \n- $\\mathcal{C}$ : curve of the evolution of the leaf width along the leaf, **from tip to base** (literature/expert knowledge/observation)\n- $s(t)$ : curvilinear abscissa of the midrib, in $cm$, as a function of thermal time $t$, such that: $ ds(t) = \\sqrt{(dx(t))^2+(dy(t))^2} $ (computed from leaf curvature)\n- $w$ : final maximal width of the leaf, in $cm$ (to fix/vary within a reasonable range)\n- $L$ : final length of the leaf, in $cm$ (to fix/vary within a reasonable range)\n- $t$ : thermal time, in $^oC.day$\n\n\nThe objective is to find, for each growing leaf, at each time step, and for a given leaf area provided to the leaf $\\frac{d\\mathcal{A}}{dt}$, how much length $ds(t)$ is added to the leaf.\n\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathcal{A}}{dt} = 2w |\\int_{s(t-1)/L}^{s(t)/L} \\mathcal{C}(\\frac{s(u)}{L})d\\frac{s(u)}{L}| $$\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $\\mathcal{C}$ being at least $C^0$ on $[0,L]$, $F$ being the antiderivative of $\\mathcal{C}$, we can write:\n\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathcal{A}}{dt} = 2w (|F(\\frac{s(t)}{L}) - F(\\frac{s(t-1)}{L})|) $$\n\n$$ F(\\frac{s(t)}{L}) = |\\frac{1}{2w} \\frac{d\\mathcal{A}}{dt} + F(\\frac{s(t-1)}{L})| $$\n\nKnowing the other variables, we know have to determine $s(t)$ at thermal time $t$.\n\n## Apparition and growth of phytomers (stem and leaf)\n\nThe height of the plant/canopy (here we consider the height of the main stem) is given by the crop model.  \nThe plastochron (i.e. leaf initiation rate, in $leaf^{-1}$) is the time interval between two successive leaves produced at the SAM.  \nThe phyllochron (i.e. leaf emergence rate, in $leaf^{-1}$) is the time interval between two successive leaves emerging from the top of the former leaf sheath.  \nThe time for a leaf to grow is roughly between 1.5 and 2 phyllochrons.  \nWe consider a linear (rough approximation of beta function) growth for the leaf.  \n\n- $\\phi$ : phyllochron, in $^oC.day.leaf^{-1}$ (literature)\n- cur_len_int : current length of growing internodes\n- fin_len_int : final length of internodes, in $cm$ (literature, bell shaped model too ?)\n- height : plant height, in $cm$ (given by crop model)\n- $[s(t)]$ : current length of growing leaves, in $cm$ (computed before)\n- fin_len_leaf : final length of leaves, in $cm$  (bell shaped model)\n- leaf expansion duration, as $x * \\phi$, in $^oC.day$ (literature, cf Clerget et al., 2008, etc)  \n\nCf Fournier et al, 2005; Stewart and Dwyer, 1993; Skinner and Nelson, 1995  \n\n\n\nFrom crop model: \n\n## Modifying the MTG of a growing plant\n\nThere are several ways to conceive the MTG for a growing plant.  \n\nAt each thermal time step, the turtle visits each element and adds a value to a time series for each (almost) properties of the MTG.   \n\n**OR**   \n\nAt each thermal time step, the MTG is replicated and the growing elements ar modified, and new elements are added if needed.  \n\n## Fit plant growth and development to LAI(t) and height(t) curves\n\nLAI(t) curve\n\nTwo constraints :\n\n$$ \\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{A_scaled} = 2 * w * |\\int_{0}^{L} \\mathcal{C}(\\frac{s(u)}{L})d\\frac{s(u)}{L}| $$\n$$ \\text{leaf length} = L * e^{-\\log(skew) * (2 * (r - rmax)^2 + (r - rmax)^3)} $$\nr = np.linspace(1. / nb_phy, 1, nb_phy)\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Bending dynamics of leaves and
