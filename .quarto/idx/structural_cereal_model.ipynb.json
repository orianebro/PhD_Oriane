The repartition of their lengths along the axis can be approximated with a geometric model.\n\n## Manage leaf lengths as a function of height\n\nLeaves that grow on an axis have varying lengths. The repartition of their lengths along the axis can be approximated with a bell shaped model.\n\n## Arrange a leaf to be placed along a stem with a given inclination.\n\nA leaf must undergo a translation to be placed against the surface of the stem (tangent to it), and a rotation to be tilted like the stem (inclination = 1 if main stem).\n\n## Build the whole plant shoot in 3D, as an MTG.\n\nAn MTG (Multiscale Tree Graph) is created as a representation of a parametrized cereal shoot.  \nThe different scales are: \n- Plant  \n- Axis  \n- Metamer  \n- Stem / Leaf  \n- StemElement / LeafElement  \n\n## Display scenes according to different scenarii\n\n### A single cereal\n\nLet's dig into the propreties of the MTG of a cereal shoot.\n\nThe leaf lengths and widths follow the bell shaped curve described before.  \nThe first internode in the MTG actually corresponds to the pseudostem, i.e. the about 4 to 8 short first internodes that rapidly lose their leaves. The lengths following internodes follow the geometric model described before.\n\n### A cereal crop with variability\n\n### A seemingly growing plant\n\n### An intercrop organized in rows\n\n## Tillering / Branching\n\nIn progress ...  \n\nFirst, basipetal tillers, straight, oriented according to a certain angle, appearing according to a certain timing\n\n## Leaf senescence\n\nIn progress ...  \n\nRate of senescence ? Constant number of leaves on a stem from a certain point or not ?\n\n## Light interception with Caribu\n\nIn progress ...  \n\nWe have to configure Caribu to simulate the same light as in STICS\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Adapt for different species (parameters for cereals, some functions for legumes)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":true,"highlight-style":"pygments","output-file":"structural_cereal_model.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
